# Image Resizing Project

This project demonstrates various image upsampling and downsampling techniques using OpenCV and Python. It includes both built-in OpenCV methods and a custom implementation for pixel replication upsampling.

## Features
- Nearest Neighbor Upsampling (OpenCV)
- Bilinear Interpolation Upsampling (OpenCV)
- Custom Pixel Replication Upsampling (from scratch)
- Nearest Neighbor Downsampling (OpenCV)
- Bilinear Interpolation Downsampling (OpenCV)
- Area Interpolation Downsampling (OpenCV)
- Visual comparison and histogram plotting for all results

## Requirements
Install dependencies using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Place your input image (e.g., `adel_shaklll.jpg`) in the project directory.
2. Open and run the `image_resizing.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
3. Follow the notebook cells to see the results of different resizing techniques and their visual comparisons.

## Files
- `image_resizing.ipynb`: Main notebook with code and explanations.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `adel_shaklll.jpg`: Example input image (replace with your own if desired).
